## Project/Goals

This analysis would benefit people who are looking forward to buy a property OR already have a property in New York City and are considering to become an Airbnb host to earn an extra income. This analysis will provide gaze at the current airbnb market.

### created visual insights of the analysis

other interesting insights can be seen in the dashboard


## Challenges 

Lack of enough data andtime was one of the issues that I faced, Although it was enough to accomplish deliverables within the scope of the project but I wanted to include insights relating to occupancy of a listing if I had more data or more time to look for that data.

## Future Goals

My future plan for this project is to bring in data on occupancy rate for each listing so I can better predict the revenue generated from each type of listings. Also I would like to add more cities to this research.
